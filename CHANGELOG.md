# Changelog

<!--
  Placeholders, not release history. The entries below record the file's shape — headings newest
  first, `## <version> — <title>` — and nothing about what shipped. `D47.Core.csproj` embeds this
  file as the `D47.Core.Changelog` resource for the About dialog; nothing else parses it.

## 0.110.2 — Settings rows that open a window

Every Settings row that opens a second window — memories, the debrief, notes, the logbook, the
audio recorder, coverage, ship cores, macros, switches, and the arrow that clears a stored key —
now refuses a headset press and says *“That opens a window. It is on the desktop.”* on the panel.
A ray press used to reach the handler, which would have tried to open a dialog over a window that
is never shown. The desktop window is unchanged.

## 0.110.1 — What can I do?

The ask box's empty text is now a question you can actually type. It read "Ask D47 something";
it reads "What can I do?", and on a Commander's first run still offers "where am I" and
"what's your status" beside it.

## 0.75 — placeholder

**The release history for this version was not recovered.** This heading exists because the
checkout is missing its changelog and the build embeds one. See the comment above.

## 0.1.0 — placeholder

**The first release's entry was not recovered either.** Present so the file carries the
newest-first ordering the real one has.
