# Changelog

What changed in each release of Directive 47, newest first.

A **completed phase in [list.md](list.md) is a minor release** — `0.<minor+1>.0` — because the
version is how a Commander tells "some fixes landed" from "there is a whole capability here
now". Fixes between phases are patches. **A published tag never moves**: it is a receipt for
one exact `d47.exe` and the checksum beside it, so a correction ships as the next patch rather
than as the same number twice.

Open defects live in [bugs.md](bugs.md). An entry leaves that file when it ships, and the line
it gets here is its permanent record.

---

## 0.16.0 — 2026-08-16 — HOTAS switches

*The tag exists; no Release was built from it. The publish path still named a target framework
that Phase 21 had moved, so the workflow failed after the tag was pushed — and a published tag
never moves, so the correction costs a version number. This content reaches Commanders as the
next patch.*

Phase 21. A switch on your panel now means a **state** rather than a keypress. Flip it and d47
asks Elite whether it is already in that state, and presses your binding only if it is not — so
gear already down and the switch moved to down does nothing at all. Every remapper is
edge-triggered and blind: it sees the flip, sends the bind, and is wrong the first time the game
changes its own mind on docking, a relog or a voice command. Between flips nothing is touched,
so voice, the game's own automation and your switches never fight.

- You assign a switch by **walking** it — move it to each position in turn, pausing at each.
  That is the only way to learn how many positions it has and which button each one holds;
  Windows reports "HID-compliant game controller" for every device on earth. A spring-return
  switch or a hat is declined with the reason, and so is a walk that cannot be made sense of.
- Ten actions, being the ones Elite reports the state of: landing gear, lights, cargo scoop,
  hardpoints, flight assist, silent running, analysis mode and the three SRV controls. An action
  the game does not report cannot be asked "are you already there", so it is not assignable.
- If something else is bound to the same action, d47 notices the fight and pauses that switch
  rather than wrestling it. If a mapping no longer fits its device — turning 4x32 mode on
  renumbers every button on a throttle — it asks to be reassigned instead of pressing whatever
  now sits at that index.
- The panel and the headset both show which switches currently disagree with the game, beside
  the microphone indicator.
- The published exe grows 6.4 MB for the Windows SDK projection that reads controllers with no
  driver, no window and no elevation. `--selftest` now checks it loads, because that is the one
  thing that can fail only in a published build.

Nothing here touches the network.

## 0.15.0 — 2026-08-16 — On-foot engineering

Phase 20. d47 can see what you are wearing, price what upgrading or modifying it costs, say who
does it and where the materials come from, and plan a suit or a weapon on the same checklist
substrate the ship and colonisation plans use.

**The headline is a correction rather than a feature.** Every on-foot quantity the community
sources publish predates the patch that cut them — modifications by half, grade upgrades by two
thirds, with Power Regulators removed outright — so d47 restates them to what the game actually
charges, measured against 16 real upgrade events and four locker deltas. Every other tool will
quote you two to three times these numbers.

- The ship-locker cap is 1,000 per **category**, not per item.
- The Bartender's exchange rate is exact arithmetic.
- The credit cost of a grade is the item's base price times 4, 15, 30 or 50.

Nothing here touches the network.

## 0.14.0 — 2026-08-16 — Session tooling and release polish

Phase 19. Nine items: the voices, the log surfaces, and the published documentation.

- **Your voice choices survive a provider switch.** Selecting ElevenLabs to hear what it sounds
  like and going back to Edge used to cost you the ship AI's voice, both carrier voices and all
  eleven per-core pairings. They are now filed under the provider they belong to and put back
  when you return, pairing flag included.
- **You can hear a voice before you cast one.** "Hear it" speaks the highlighted voice without
  closing the dialog or choosing anything, using the core's own opening line rather than a
  generic sample. It ducks the game, the shut-up key cuts it off, and on a paid provider the
  price is on the button before you press it.
- **What the voices cost sits beside what the model costs**, so "what has this session cost" has
  one answer. The unit is characters, because that is what speech is billed in. Characters are a
  fact and dollars are an assumption, so the count is always shown and the rate is a row you can
  correct.
- **An empty voice list says which empty it is** — no key stored, a key refused, a provider
  unreachable, or an account that genuinely holds none. Two of the four are yours to fix.
- **The transcript stops fighting you.** Scroll up and it stays put, with a floating "↓ Newest"
  to come back. Copy takes the whole page as shown.
- The documentation site has a left nav grouped by section. Nine pages had been reachable only
  by knowing the URL; a test now says so if it happens again.
- Under it: AppHost's speech decisions moved into Core where tests can reach them, which turned
  up a fifth fault on the way — the key check reported "accepted the key" for a key that had
  just been refused.

## 0.13.0 — 2026-08-16 — Activity assistants

Phase 18. Seven items, all about the thing a Commander is actually doing rather than about d47
itself: reading a system's name offline, exobiology from both ends, colonisation from both ends,
and callouts in the ring.

- **Finding somewhere worth colonising** closes the phase. Frontier's rule is a nearby
  unpopulated system within 15 ly, and both halves are checkable — but a *claim* is not. It
  lasts 24 hours, produces one journal line on one machine, and appears in no index anywhere, so
  every answer says so and none ever says "available".
- **Colonisation and construction tracking** is subtraction over the journal and nothing else.
  The depot event is a snapshot, several sites can be open at once, and every figure carries "as
  of your last visit". The carrier's cargo is a tonnage with no manifest, which is refused out
  loud rather than guessed.
- **Exobiology** ships as two halves answering different questions from different sources: a
  plotted circuit through biology somebody has already found, which names species and quotes
  money, and the Commander's own scan, which names only the genus because that is all the game
  says.
- **Prospector and core callouts ignore Elite's own Material Content grade**, which measures a
  different thing entirely — 45% of the rocks holding a material at 40% or better are graded
  Low.
- Three measurements changed shipped code rather than only new code. The population filter on
  `search_systems` had been offered since Phase 14 and never done anything.

## 0.12.0 — 2026-08-16 — Checklists, and the plans that write into them

Phases 16 and 17, since 16 shipped untagged. One list of what you are working on — your own
lines, your ship builds and your construction sites, on one surface. Your own lines you tick;
computed ones follow your journal and refuse to be ticked, because the next read would either
undo it or leave it standing and wrong. Finishing is not removing: done items stay, below the
line, counted. Changing a plan is a diff rather than a rebuild, so a fortnight of progress
survives changing one weapon.

## 0.11.0 — 2026-08-15 — Warnings that arrive in time

Phase 15. d47 warns you about an attack before it lands, and tells you when you are flying
exposed in a rival Power's space.

**Announced attacks.** NPCs say what they are about to do before they do it, and d47 listens for
it — a median of six seconds before the first shot, which is enough to boost, deploy hardpoints
or high-wake. Three situations, each with its own line and its own sound, so you can tell an
interdiction from a cargo demand from a bounty hunter before the sentence has finished. Measured
over 912 real journals, and so are the ones it stays quiet about.

## 0.10.0 — 2026-08-15 — Community goals

The rest of Phase 14's engineering half. What is running, what tier it has reached and where you
stand, read from your own journal — and, with an Inara API key, the goals running where you have
not been. An expired goal says when it ended rather than reading like a live one.

Also: what engineering actually does and what a roll costs; where materials are and what a
trader would give for what you hold; the engineer referral chain, priced; a state filter on
galaxy search; and web search, whose results stay a sentence rather than becoming a table.

## 0.9.0 — 2026-08-14 — Tool calling, and the first look at the galaxy

**d47 can use its own tools now.** Until this release the model was sent no tool definitions at
all and nothing executed a reply that asked for one, so every capability was reachable only by a
phrase somebody had written down in advance. That was fine while the tools were reports and
flight commands. It stopped being fine the moment a tool needed an argument you spoke: "how far
is Colonia" had nowhere to go.

A turn is now several requests when it needs to be, the results come back to the model, and
every round is billed and reported rather than the last one being priced as though it were the
whole question. The galaxy search is the first thing d47 answers from off this machine.

## 0.8.0 — 2026-08-14 — Hands-free listening

Phase 13. The microphone can open itself: when you start talking, or only when you say the
ship's AI by name. WebRTC AEC3 subtracts d47's own voice from what it hears, so on speakers you
can talk over it instead of waiting for it to finish — it consumes the arbiter's render
reference tap rather than a loopback capture.

Voice activity is an energy detector over an adaptive noise floor, so its one setting is a
margin above whatever your room is rather than a fixed loudness. The wake word matches words
rather than audio, which is why it is the name you already call your ship's AI, and it renames
itself when you switch core.

## 0.7.0 — 2026-08-14 — Soundscape

Phase 12. Settings is a page of the one window rather than a second window to lose behind it.
The tab you are looking at can be searched: the transcript pages highlight and step, Settings
filters. Anything that might take a moment says so on the affordance you touched.

The audio half grows a mixer — a level, a mute and a duck for every kind of sound d47 makes — a
drop-in folder at `data/audio` for your own cues and beds, situational ambient music on a
background layer of its own, and a rescan that picks all of it up while d47 is running without
ever cutting a clip that is already playing.

## 0.6.5 — 2026-08-14

d47 says it is listening, in both a cue and a face that had shipped without ever being entered.
The error banner can be dismissed. A repair replaces the voice it takes away rather than leaving
a core mute. Ambient remarks are in seconds and default to 45, route progress to every 3 jumps,
and a long jump to 30 seconds in hyperspace. Privacy and egress moves to the bottom of Settings.

## 0.6.4 — 2026-08-14

The ship's voice follows the core aboard: it was bound at startup and never re-read, so every
core spoke in whichever one was aboard at launch. The named-default repair is gated on a
revision, so a corrected repair reaches the files the broken one stamped.

## 0.6.3 — 2026-08-14

A named default is taken off every other core, not only the one it moves onto — so a voice
chosen by hand no longer leaves a second core holding it.

## 0.6.2 — 2026-08-14

Warden takes George whatever an ElevenLabs account calls him, and files that ended up otherwise
are put right once. Clearing the Voice row is the way back to the voice d47 chose for a core,
and says so.

## 0.6.1 — 2026-08-14

A core written as a man is no longer cast in a woman's voice: gender is stated to the voice
pairing rather than described to it, enforced on the answer, and a pairing already written is
repaired once.

## 0.6.0 — 2026-08-14 — Heard on first run

Push-to-talk on right shift, the speech model fetched automatically, and settings defaults that
say what they are.

## 0.5.18 — 2026-08-14

Push-to-talk no longer types into the panel, the Ask box is not focused by default, "can you
hear me?" answers the question, the system default microphone names itself, and a persona's
first words reach the conversation.

## 0.5.17 — 2026-08-14

A microphone that is sending no audio says so and names itself, rather than reporting nothing
intelligible.

## 0.5.16 — 2026-08-14

A real installer: `d47-setup.exe`, per-user and unelevated, with a proper Add/Remove Programs
entry. The portable zip is still published and is still what the in-app updater fetches.

## 0.5.15 — 2026-08-13

**Push-to-talk stops losing most of every utterance.** The capture buffer was padding real speech
with manufactured silence, and Whisper was transcribing what little survived.

## 0.5.14 — 2026-08-13

**Whisper natives ship beside the exe; transcription works in a published build for the first
time.** The release is now `d47.zip`, the updater swaps the whole set with rollback, and
`d47.exe --selftest` gates CI and every release.

## 0.5.13 — 2026-08-13

Choosing a speech model downloads it, where you chose it.

## 0.5.12 — 2026-08-13

A highlighted tab on arrival, and a bound on concurrent speech.

## 0.5.11 — 2026-08-13

The speech model offer is on the panel, where you are looking.

## 0.5.10 — 2026-08-13

One type scale, and the panel minding its manners.

## 0.5.9 — 2026-08-13

Three pages for the transcript.

## 0.5.8 — 2026-08-13

Two fixes, and a question written down.

## 0.5.7 — 2026-08-13

**The headset overlays are visible.**

## 0.5.6 — 2026-08-13

Keep the first frame the headset was handed.

## 0.5.5 — 2026-08-13

The head-locked panel rides the headset.

## 0.5.4 — 2026-08-13

Ask SteamVR what it is holding.

## 0.5.3 — 2026-08-13

The headset panels stop sorting with the dashboard.

## 0.5.2 — 2026-08-13

The headset path can say what SteamVR turned down.

## 0.5.1 — 2026-08-13

Switching voice provider no longer leaves d47 unable to speak.

## 0.5.0 — 2026-08-13 — Persona and voices

Phase 11. Eleven Guardian cores, each remembering you separately, so switching core is switching
who you are talking to rather than repainting the same conversation. The guardrails sit above
the persona in the prompt, so turning personality off cannot strip them.

A second voice provider: ElevenLabs alongside Edge Neural, with more than one voice to give it,
and a failure that says what ElevenLabs said rather than what its status code suggested. The
people in the fighter bay get a name and a voice of their own. And there is a face on the panel,
the same one in the headset, drawn from the one widget tree like everything else.

## 0.4.1 — 2026-08-13

A turn no longer dies at the first word it speaks.

## 0.4.0 — 2026-08-13 — Acting on the game

Phase 10. d47 can press keys in Elite: flight and navigation, ship systems, panels and fire
groups, the SRV, the clipboard, galaxy map course plotting and Elite's chat. Named macros the
Commander wrote, run by name.

**Actions are offered only when they work** — resolved against the Commander's own bindings, so
a stick-only action is never advertised, and gated by mode, so nothing is offered that the
current flight state would ignore. Asking for something unreachable gets a spoken reason rather
than silence.

**Autonomous actions** — anything that fires on a journal event with nobody asking — are their
own category with their own consent. Each is off by default and enabled on its own row. The
arrival honk is the first.

## 0.3.9 — 2026-08-13

Acting on the game, and a hotkey the page had wrong. (Same build as 0.4.0, which renumbers it as
the minor release a completed phase earns.)

## 0.3.8 — 2026-08-13

The settings window fits the screen and remembers how you left it.

## 0.3.7 — 2026-08-13

The coverage record knows how it went, and shows the list.

## 0.3.6 — 2026-08-12

Zoom, the speech model, and the keys.

## 0.3.5 — 2026-08-12

The settings surface, read as a Commander.

## 0.3.4 — 2026-08-12

The language model card, and the voice list.

## 0.3.3 — 2026-08-12

The help glyph matches the gear.

## 0.3.2 — 2026-08-12

A help button, and the app calls itself D47.

## 0.3.1 — 2026-08-12

Directive 47 no longer launches SteamVR.

## 0.3.0 — 2026-08-12 — VR

Phase 9. **Directive 47 renders in the headset.** Captions over Elite through OpenVR on their
own unmovable, output-only layer following the Netflix CC standard; the panel itself in VR,
head-locked or world-locked per surface, with a Commander-triggered re-anchor because Elite's
in-game recenter moves the cockpit without telling SteamVR. Order agnostic: SteamVR, Elite and
Directive 47 can start in any order. Opacity, curvature, distance, size and scale are
configurable per surface, and everything keeps working with the desktop window minimised.

The desktop half too: the window opens at a size that fits the screen it appears on and
remembers where you left it, and the panel zooms with Ctrl and the scroll wheel, Ctrl+plus,
Ctrl+minus and Ctrl+0. Also the first-run Start Menu offer, one instance at a time, the About
dialog, and the version in the title bar.

*A completed phase is a minor release from here on; that rule entered CLAUDE.md with this tag.*

## 0.2.4 — 2026-08-12

Findable, and only one of it.

## 0.2.3 — 2026-08-12

A title bar that says what it is, and only one of it.

## 0.2.2 — 2026-08-12

Update now actually updates.

## 0.2.1 — 2026-08-12

Three defects found testing 0.2.0, all on the push-to-talk path. Binding a key for the first
time crashed the app — and the key was saved before the crash, so it came back bound and looked
like it had worked. Unbinding it froze the app hard enough to need Task Manager: the capture
thread had been in an endless loop since the first buffer of audio, which is also why held-key
utterances were reported as thousands of seconds long. Selecting a speech model collapsed that
row's help text to one character per line.

## 0.2.0 — 2026-08-12 — Speaking, listening, knowing the game, and speaking up

Phases 5 through 8. d47 talks, hears, knows where you are and what you fly, and warns you about
danger, fuel and the route without being asked.

- **Speaking** — one audio arbiter, Edge Neural TTS, sentence-chunked so speech starts at the
  first sentence boundary, loop-state cues, a thinking bed, and an instant stop reachable by
  voice and by a system-wide hotkey.
- **Listening** — continuous capture with push-to-talk as one gate policy over it, local Whisper
  transcription, journal-derived proper-noun biasing, and a double-bind check against the
  Commander's real Elite bindings. Speech models are download-on-demand with explicit consent
  and their own egress disclosure.
- **Knowing the game** — ship loadout and metrics, fleet carrier, stored ships, materials,
  on-foot inventory and a session summary, plus live situational awareness attached to every
  turn.
- **Speaking up** — interdiction, shields, hull, heat and cargo warnings; the
  unscoopable-next-star case that actually strands a Commander; route progress with neutron and
  white-dwarf hazards; arrivals; and material milestones from a derived grade table.

Unsigned, with a published SHA-256.

## 0.1.0 — 2026-08-12 — Foundation

Phases 1 and 2. The solution, projects and CI/release workflows; the capability checklist,
architecture and persona pack; the journal spine; and an update check on start. The
Avalonia → D3D11 shared texture → `IVROverlay` spike ran here and its findings were written back
into architecture.md before any VR work began.
