# Open bugs

Defects only. Feature and polish work lives in [list.md](list.md).

An item leaves this file when it ships, and its record from then on is the line it gets
in `CHANGELOG.md` under the release that fixed it. There is deliberately no
`fixed-bugs.md`: a second copy of that history is one nobody reads and one that rots.

Each entry states what was seen, what was verified in the code, and what is still only a
hypothesis. **A lead is not a diagnosis** — reproduce before fixing, and per the standing
rule, reintroduce the fault afterwards and watch the new test fail.

## None open.

The four that were here shipped in 0.16.2, and the log-routing one in 0.21.1. Their record is
those sections of the changelog.

The VR grab that 0.16.2 recorded as "fixed but not confirmed" was not fixed. The two flags it
called are the wrong road entirely — they opt the quad in to SteamVR's own laser, which only runs
over SteamVR's dashboard, so the events they unlock never arrive while Elite holds the headset.
0.22.1 replaced the whole channel; see its changelog section.

**Still not confirmed, for the same reason as before.** Nothing on this side of the headset can
say whether a Commander can now pick the panel up. What the tests cover is the manifest's shape,
the ray arithmetic and the beam and cursor geometry; what they cannot reach is whether SteamVR
actually binds the trigger. If it does not, `vrserver.txt` is the file that says so.
